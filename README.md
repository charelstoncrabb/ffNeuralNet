# ffNeuralNet
A basic C++ API for training feed-forward neural networks

This code relies on the <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">Eigen linear algebra library</a>.

The tests in the FFNNTest class include the MNIST benchmark, so these training and test files are needed to run the tests.
